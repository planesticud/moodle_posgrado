## General information ##

The collapsible topics format is a clone of the core topics format that adds collapsing behaviour to sections in order to reduce page size. A plugin setting allow to retain topics collapse state on a per user basis for the current session or across sessions.
This plugin is an alternative to Gareth J. Barnard's format_topcoll plugin (see references below)
The purpose is to offer a simple collapsing behaviour for sections in order to reduce course home page size without all the display options that Gareth's plugin offers.
